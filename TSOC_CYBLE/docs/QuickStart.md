The thingSoC "Grovey Series" was designed as "Everyday Electronics", a no-frills, low cost, approach to modular embedded product design.
thingSoC boards are similar in size to most break-out-boards (BOBs), but feature a standardized stacking pinout, as well as an I2C metadata store (EEPROM)
to indicate what peripherals are installed.
